                        <h3>Identifying Brain Tumours with AI</h3>
                        <p class="project-summary">In this project, I ventured into the realm of medical image analysis with a primary focus on identifying Meniginoma Tumours using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The motivation behind this undertaking was rooted in the profound potential for non-invasive treatment and precise medical diagnosis, ultimately contributing to improved patient care.</p>

                        <h4>Skills Demonstrated:</h4>
                        <p class="project-details">Throughout this project, I honed my skills in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Leveraging TensorFlow, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn, I constructed and fine-tuned the CNN model to ensure consistent high precision in tumor identification. This experience allowed me to demonstrate not only my proficiency in these advanced technologies but also my ability to apply them effectively to real-world healthcare challenges.</p>

                        <h4>Skills Demonstrated:</h4>
                        <p>This project was built using Python, and the Tkinter library. Along the way, I encountered various challenges, particularly in the 6502 microprocessor's instruction set. Crafting an intuitive user interface that facilitated interaction and educated users about CPU operations was equally rewarding. Through persistent effort, extensive research, and diligent debugging, I created an educational tool that aims to breathe life into the captivating world of computing. </p>
